                Hi Kassi! Happy first anniversary! I wanted to create this page to share
                the memories and the good times we've had together, reminding ourselves of what we've done 
                but also of what the future can hold. It's been such a memorable first year with you, and
                I am so excited to see what the future holds with you. I love you so much, and I can't wait
                to see you grow and develop.
